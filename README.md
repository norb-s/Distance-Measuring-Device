# Distance-Measuring-Device
This project is made using tinkercad, I have used an ultrasonic measuring device, a piezo, LCD, and LED lights to make this project.

The program works this way:
1. Red light will turn on and a buzzer will make a sound if the distance is below 10 cm.
2. Yellow light will brighten up when the distance is between 11-20 cm.
3. Green light will power up when the distance is greater than 20 cm. 

The distance will be shown in the LCD panel.
